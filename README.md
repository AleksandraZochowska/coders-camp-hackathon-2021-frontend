# Questio

The first version of **Questio** was created during the CodersCamp Hackaton. The goal was to create an application that will help teams work and collaborate remotely.

## The reason behind

Recently the number of people, teams, organizations working remotely increased significantly. Each one of us needs to spend hours on online meetings.

-   If you ever had a chance to lead the lecture, meeting, presentation and had this feeling that participants on the other side of the network connection are hardly listening or not paying attention at all to what you are saying?
-   Or were you the person on the other side, the one who listened and struggled to stay focused, constantly zoning out?

**Questio is what you need.**

## The solution

**Questio** is a simple and easy way to maintain or even test the focus of the meeting participants.

The presenter can log into the application, prepare the list of questions connected to the presentation's topic and invite his listeners to join the room, using just a link. Then the room creator can post questions, live, during the presentation. The meeting participants have to answer within specified by the room creator time. Thus they need to actively participate in the meeting. Afterward, both sides have an access to statistics regarding the answers.
